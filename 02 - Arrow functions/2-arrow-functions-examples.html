const race = '100m Dash';
const winners = ['Hunter Gath', 'Singa Song', 'Imda Bos'];

// Now we want the arrow funcion to return an object, so we wrap the curly brackets in parethesis:
// Implicit return with an object literal
const win = winners.map((winner, i) => ({name: winner, race, place: i + 1}));

// Nifty tip: to view object in a table:
console.table(win);

// ES6 feature: 
// For property race, instead of using race: race, which seems redundant, you can just use race

// Arrow function that filters an array:
const ages = [23,62,45,234,2,62,234,62,34];
const old = ages.filter(age => age >= 60);
console.log(old);
